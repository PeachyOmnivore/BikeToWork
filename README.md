# BikeToWork

## Description

This is a Bike to work application based of a previous google sheet application that I used in a previous job. The purpose of this application is to allow an employer or leader of a group to track when users bike to work and run a randomized draw to determine a winner at set intervals. The user should be able to input when they biked to work and should only be able to enter one entry per day. The owner or supervisor of the application should be able to approve or deny the entries. At the end of a set period the supervisor should be able to see all the entries and run a randomized draw which pulls a entry. It is up to the supervisor on how they would like the handle the inforamtion provided.
